# Question 1: What specialties do we have?

We can use count() from dplyr to figure out how many different
catagories do we have? Are these catagories related? overlapping? evenly
distributed?

``` r
special <- mts %>%
  count(medical_specialty)

special %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## [1] 40

There are 40 medical specialties.

``` r

# Question 2

Tokenize the the words in the transcription column.

-   Count the number of times each token appears
-   Visualize the top 20 most frequent words
-   Explain what we see from this result. Does it makes sense? What
    insights (if any) do we get?

``` r
mts %>%
  unnest_tokens(token, transcription) %>%
  count(token,sort = TRUE)
```

    ## # A tibble: 23,646 × 2
    ##    token        n
    ##    <chr>    <int>
    ##  1 the     149888
    ##  2 and      82779
    ##  3 was      71765
    ##  4 of       59205
    ##  5 to       50632
    ##  6 a        42810
    ##  7 with     35815
    ##  8 in       32807
    ##  9 is       26378
    ## 10 patient  22065
    ## # … with 23,636 more rows

``` r
## visualization
mts %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, transcription) %>%
  count(word) %>%
  top_n(20,n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n,y=fct_reorder(word,n)))+
  geom_col()
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- --> A lots f
stopwords here, no specific medical text.

# Question 3

-   Redo visualization but remove stopwords before.
-   Bonus points if you remove numbers as well.
-   What do we see know that we have removed stop words? Does it give us
    a better idea of what the text is about?

``` r
mts %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, transcription) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>%
  count(word) %>%
  top_n(20,n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n,y=fct_reorder(word,n)))+
  geom_col()
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
mts %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, transcription) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>%
  # use regular expression to filter out numbers
  filter(!grepl(pattern = '^[0-9]+$',x=word))%>%
  count(word) %>%
  top_n(20,n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n,y=fct_reorder(word,n)))+
  geom_col()
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

# Question 4

repeat question 2, but this time tokenize into bi-grams. how does the
result change if you look at tri-grams?

``` r
# Bigrams
mts %>%
  unnest_ngrams(bigram, transcription, n = 2) %>%
  count(bigram) %>%
  top_n(20,n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n,y=fct_reorder(bigram,n)))+
  geom_col()
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# Trigrams
mts %>%
  unnest_ngrams(trigram, transcription, n = 3) %>%
  count(trigram) %>%
  top_n(20,n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n,y=fct_reorder(trigram,n)))+
  geom_col()
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- --> Top 30
trigrams seemed to return a few more medical word group than bigrams.

# Question 5

Using the results you got from questions 4. Pick a word and count the
words that appears after and before it.

``` r
ptbigram <- mts %>%
  unnest_ngrams(bigram, transcription, n = 2) %>%
  separate(bigram, into = c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>%
  select(word1, word2) %>%
  filter(word1=='patient'|word2=='patient')
```

Words appearing before patients:

``` r
ptbigram %>%
  filter(word2=='patient') %>%
  count(word1, sort = TRUE) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words,by=c('word1'='word'))%>%
  top_n(10) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## Selecting by n

| word1       |   n |
|:------------|----:|
| history     | 101 |
| procedure   |  32 |
| female      |  26 |
| sample      |  23 |
| male        |  22 |
| illness     |  16 |
| plan        |  16 |
| indications |  15 |
| allergies   |  14 |
| correct     |  11 |
| detail      |  11 |

Words after

``` r
ptbigram %>%
  filter(word1=='patient') %>%
  count(word2, sort = TRUE) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words,by=c('word2'='word'))%>%
  top_n(10)%>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## Selecting by n

| word2      |   n |
|:-----------|----:|
| tolerated  | 994 |
| denies     | 552 |
| underwent  | 180 |
| received   | 160 |
| reports    | 155 |
| understood | 113 |
| lives      |  81 |
| admits     |  69 |
| appears    |  68 |
| including  |  67 |

# Question 6

Which words are most used in each of the specialties. you can use
group_by() and top_n() from dplyr to have the calculations be done
within each specialty. Remember to remove stopwords. How about the most
5 used words?

``` r
mts %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, transcription) %>%
  group_by(medical_specialty)%>%
  count(word,sort=TRUE) %>%
  # use regular expression to filter out numbers
  filter(!(word %in% stop_words$word) & !grepl(pattern = '^[0-9]+$',x=word))%>%
  top_n(5,n) %>%
  arrange(medical_specialty,desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
