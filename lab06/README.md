# Question 1: What specialties do we have?

We can use count() from dplyr to figure out how many different
catagories do we have? Are these catagories related? overlapping? evenly
distributed?

``` r
special <- mts %>%
  count(medical_specialty)

special %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

``` r
length(unique(mts$medical_specialty))
```

    ## [1] 40

There are 40 medical specialties.

``` r
special %>%
  top_n(10,n)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n,y=fct_reorder(medical_specialty,n)))+
  geom_col()
```

# Question 2

Tokenize the the words in the transcription column -Count the number of
times each token appears -Visualize the top 20 most frequent words
-Explain what we see from this result. Does it makes sense? What
insights (if any) do we get?

``` r
mts %>%
  unnest_tokens(token, transcription) %>%
  count(token,sort = TRUE)
```

    ## # A tibble: 23,646 × 2
    ##    token        n
