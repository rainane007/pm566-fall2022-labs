## Q1 How many sars-cov-2 papers?

```{r}
# Downloading the website
website <- xml2::read_html("https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=sars-cov-2")

# Finding the counts
counts <- xml2::xml_find_first(website, "/html/body/main/div[9]/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")

# Turning it into text
counts <- as.character(counts)

# Extracting the data using regex
stringr::str_extract(counts, "[0-9,]+")
```

## Q2 Academic publications on COVID19 and Hawaii
You need to query the following The parameters passed to the query are documented here.

Use the function httr::GET() to make the following query:

Baseline URL: https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi

Query parameters:

db: pubmed
term: covid19 hawaii
retmax: 1000

```{r}
query_ids <- GET(
  url   = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi",
  query = list(db='pubmed',
               term = 'covid19 hawaii',
               retmax= 1000)
)

# Extracting the content of the response of GET
ids <- httr::content(query_ids)
```

The query will return an XML object, we can turn it into a character list to analyze the text directly with as.character(). Another way of processing the data could be using lists with the function xml2::as_list(). We will skip the latter for now.


## Question 3: Get details about the articles
The Ids are wrapped around text in the following way: <Id>... id number ...</Id>. we can use a regular expression that extract that information. Fill out the following lines of code:

```{r}
# Turn the result into a character vector
ids <- as.character(ids)

# Find all the ids 
ids <- stringr::str_extract_all(ids, "<Id>[[:digit:]]+</Id>")[[1]]

# Remove all the leading and trailing <Id> </Id>. Make use of "|"
ids <- stringr::str_remove_all(ids, '</?Id>')
```

With the ids in hand, we can now try to get the abstracts of the papers. As before, we will need to coerce the contents (results) to a list using:

Baseline url: https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi

Query parameters:

db: pubmed
id: A character with all the ids separated by comma, e.g., “1232131,546464,13131”
retmax: 1000
rettype: abstract

Pro-tip: If you want GET() to take some element literal, wrap it around I() (as you would do in a formula in R). For example, the text "123,456" is replaced with "123%2C456". If you don’t want that behavior, you would need to do the following I("123,456").

```{r}

publications <- GET(
  url   = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi",
  query = list(
    db='pubmed',
    id=paste(ids,collapse =','),
    retmax=1000,
    rettype='abstract'
    )
)

# Turning the output into character vector
publications <- httr::content(publications)
publications_txt <- as.character(publications)
```
