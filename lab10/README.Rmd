# Set up
```{r}
if(!require(RSQLite)) install.packages(c('RSQLite'))
if(!require(DBI)) install.packages(c('DBI'))

library(RSQLite)
library(DBI)

# Initialize a temporary in memory database
con <- dbConnect(SQLite(), ":memory:")

# Download tables
actor <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/actor.csv")
rental <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/rental.csv")
customer <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/customer.csv")
payment <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/payment_p2007_01.csv")

# Copy data.frames to database
dbWriteTable(con, "actor", actor)
dbWriteTable(con, "rental", rental)
dbWriteTable(con, "customer", customer)
dbWriteTable(con, "payment", payment)
```

```{sql,connection=con}
PRAGMA table_info(actor)
```

An alterenatives would be
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,
'PRAGMA table_info(actor)')
```

# Exercise 1
Retrive the actor ID, first name and last name for all actors using the actor table. Sort by last name and then by first name.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,
  "SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
  FROM actor 
  ORDER BY last_name, first_name
  ")
```
Try in SQL directly

```{sql,connection=con}
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM actor 
ORDER BY last_name, first_name
```


#Exercise 2

Retrive the actor ID, first name, and last name for actors whose last name equals ‘WILLIAMS’ or ‘DAVIS’.

```{sql,connection=con}
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM actor
WHERE last_name IN ('WILLIAMS', 'DAVIS')
```

#Exercise 3

Write a query against the `rental` table that returns the IDs of the customers who rented a film on July 5, 2005 (use the rental.rental_date column, and you can use the date() function to ignore the time component). Include a single row for each distinct customer ID.

```{sql,connection=con}
PRAGMA table_info(rental)
```

```{sql,connection=con}
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, rental_date
FROM rental
WHERE date(rental_date) = '2005-07-05'
```
```{sql,connection=con}
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id,COUNT(*) AS N
FROM rental
WHERE date(rental_date) = '2005-07-05'
GROUP BY customer_id
```

# Exercise 4

```{sql,connection=con}
PRAGMA table_info(payment)
```
## 4.1
Construct a query that retrives all rows from the `payment` table where the amount is either 1.99, 7.99, 9.99.

```{sql,connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE amount IN (1.99, 7.99, 9.99)
```

## 4.2
Construct a query that retrives all rows from the `payment` table where the amount is greater then 5

```{sql,connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE amount > 5
```

## 4.3
Construct a query that retrives all rows from the `payment` table where the amount is greater then 5 and less then 8
```{sql,connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE amount > 5 AND amount < 8
```

# Exercise 5
Retrive all the payment IDs and their amount from the customers whose last name is ‘DAVIS’.

```{sql,connection=con}
PRAGMA table_info(customer)
```

```{sql,connection=con}
SELECT c.customer_id, payment_id, amount
FROM payment AS p
  INNER JOIN customer AS c
  ON p.customer_id=c.customer_id
WHERE last_name ='DAVIS'
```


# Exercise 6
## 6.1
Use COUNT(*) to count the number of rows in rental

```{sql,connection=con}
SELECT COUNT(*) AS N
FROM rental
```

## 6.2
Use COUNT(*) and GROUP BY to count the number of rentals for each customer_id
```{sql,connection=con}
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS N
FROM rental
GROUP BY customer_id
LIMIT 8
```

## 6.3
Repeat the previous query and sort by the count in descending order
```{sql,connection=con}
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS N
FROM rental
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY N DESC
LIMIT 8
```

## 6.4
Repeat the previous query but use HAVING to only keep the groups with 40 or more.
```{sql,connection=con}
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS N
FROM rental
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING N >=40 /* have to be followed by group*/
ORDER BY N DESC
```


# Exercise 7

The following query calculates a number of summary statistics for the payment table using MAX, MIN, AVG and SUM
```{sql,connection=con}
SELECT MAX(amount) AS maxpayment,
       MIN(amount) AS minpayment,
       AVG(amount) AS avgpayment,
       SUM(amount) AS sumpayment
FROM payment
```

## 7.1

Modify the above query to do those calculations for each customer_id

```{sql,connection=con}
SELECT customer_id,
       MAX(amount) AS maxpayment,
       MIN(amount) AS minpayment,
       AVG(amount) AS avgpayment,
       SUM(amount) AS sumpayment
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
LIMIT 10
```

## 7.2

Modify the above query to only keep the customer_ids that have more then 5 payments

```{sql,connection=con}
SELECT customer_id,
       MAX(amount) AS maxpayment,
       MIN(amount) AS minpayment,
       AVG(amount) AS avgpayment,
       SUM(amount) AS sumpayment,
       COUNT(*) AS N
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING N >5
```

# clean up
```{r}
dbDisconnect(con)
```
